# Supabase Storage Setup Guide

This guide shows you how to set up file storage in Supabase so users can upload documents to cases.

## Problem

When users try to upload documents, they get an error: **"Bucket not found"**

This happens because the storage bucket hasn't been created in your Supabase project yet.

---

## Solution: Create Storage Bucket in Supabase

### Step 1: Access Your Supabase Project

1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Sign in to your account
3. Click on your project: **yvnkyjnwvylrweyzvibs**

### Step 2: Navigate to Storage

1. In the left sidebar, click **"Storage"**
2. You'll see the Storage dashboard

### Step 3: Create New Bucket

1. Click the **"New bucket"** button (or "Create a new bucket")
2. Fill in the bucket details:
   - **Name:** `case-documents` (must be exactly this name)
   - **Public:** Toggle **OFF** (keep it private for security)
   - **File size limit:** Optional - set to 50MB or as needed
   - **Allowed MIME types:** Leave empty or specify: `image/*,application/pdf,application/msword,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.*`

3. Click **"Create bucket"**

### Step 4: Set Up Bucket Policies (Security)

After creating the bucket, you need to set access policies:

1. Click on the **"case-documents"** bucket
2. Go to the **"Policies"** tab
3. Click **"New Policy"**

#### Policy 1: Allow Authenticated Users to Upload

Click **"Create a policy from scratch"**

**Policy Name:** `Authenticated users can upload`

**Target Roles:** `authenticated`

**Operation:** `INSERT`

**Policy Definition:**
```sql
(auth.role() = 'authenticated')
```

Click **"Review"** then **"Save policy"**

#### Policy 2: Allow Authenticated Users to Read

Click **"New Policy"** ‚Üí **"Create a policy from scratch"**

**Policy Name:** `Authenticated users can read`

**Target Roles:** `authenticated`

**Operation:** `SELECT`

**Policy Definition:**
```sql
(auth.role() = 'authenticated')
```

Click **"Review"** then **"Save policy"**

#### Policy 3: Allow Users to Delete Their Own Files (Optional)

**Policy Name:** `Users can delete own files`

**Target Roles:** `authenticated`

**Operation:** `DELETE`

**Policy Definition:**
```sql
(auth.role() = 'authenticated')
```

Click **"Review"** then **"Save policy"**

### Step 5: Test Document Upload

1. Go back to your DLPP Legal CMS application
2. Open a case
3. Go to the Documents tab
4. Click "Upload Document"
5. Select a file and fill in the details
6. Click "Upload"

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ "Document uploaded successfully!"

---

## Alternative: Quick Setup via SQL

If you prefer SQL, you can run this in the Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Note: Storage bucket creation must be done via the Supabase UI
-- But you can set up the policies via SQL after creating the bucket

-- Allow authenticated users to upload files
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'case-documents' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow authenticated users to read files
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can read"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'case-documents' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow authenticated users to update files
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'case-documents' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow authenticated users to delete files
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'case-documents' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);
```

## Verification

After setup, verify everything works:

### 1. Check Bucket Exists
- Go to Supabase ‚Üí Storage
- You should see "case-documents" bucket

### 2. Check Policies
- Click on the bucket
- Go to Policies tab
- You should see at least 2 policies (INSERT and SELECT)

### 3. Test Upload
- In DLPP CMS, upload a test document
- Check Supabase Storage ‚Üí case-documents
- You should see the uploaded file

---

## Temporary Workaround (Already Implemented)

**If you can't set up storage right now**, the system has been updated to:

1. ‚úÖ Save document metadata to the database (title, type, description)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Show a warning that file upload is disabled
3. ‚úÖ Allow you to track documents without actual files
4. üîß Enable full file upload once storage is configured

**What you'll see:**
- Warning toast: "Document record saved, but file upload disabled. Contact admin to enable storage."
- Success message: "Document record saved (file upload pending storage setup)"

**Documents will appear in the list**, but without downloadable files until storage is set up.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Bucket not found"
**Solution:** Follow Step 3 above to create the bucket

### Error: "new row violates row-level security policy"
**Solution:** Set up the bucket policies (Step 4)

### Error: "File size exceeds limit"
**Solution:**
1. Go to Storage ‚Üí case-documents ‚Üí Settings
2. Increase the file size limit
3. Or compress your files before upload

### Files Upload But Can't Download
**Solution:**
1. Make sure the SELECT policy is set (Step 4, Policy 2)
2. Check that the bucket is not accidentally set to private with no policies

### Can't See Uploaded Files in Supabase
**Solution:**
1. Go to Storage ‚Üí case-documents
2. Navigate through the folders (organized by case ID)
3. Files are stored as: `{case-id}/{timestamp}-{filename}`

---

## File Organization

Files are automatically organized in the bucket by case:

```
case-documents/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {case-id-1}/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1730000000000-complaint.pdf
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1730000001000-survey_plan.pdf
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1730000002000-photo.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {case-id-2}/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1730000003000-title_deed.pdf
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1730000004000-letter.docx
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

This keeps files organized and makes it easy to:
- Find all documents for a case
- Manage storage space
- Export case files
- Clean up old cases

---

## Security Best Practices

1. **Keep bucket private** - Don't enable public access
2. **Use RLS policies** - Only authenticated users should access files
3. **Set file size limits** - Prevent abuse (recommend 50MB max)
4. **Restrict MIME types** - Only allow document types you need
5. **Regular backups** - Supabase handles this, but verify
6. **Audit logs** - Monitor who uploads what

---

## Storage Limits

**Supabase Free Tier:**
- Storage: 1 GB
- File uploads: 50 MB per file
- Bandwidth: 2 GB per month

**Supabase Pro Tier:**
- Storage: 100 GB (then $0.021/GB)
- File uploads: 5 GB per file
- Bandwidth: 250 GB (then $0.09/GB)

**Recommendations:**
- Start with free tier for testing
- Monitor usage in Supabase dashboard
- Upgrade when you approach limits
- Implement file compression for images
- Use PDF optimization for large documents

## Next Steps

After setting up storage:

1. ‚úÖ Test document upload from the app
2. ‚úÖ Verify files appear in Supabase Storage
3. ‚úÖ Test document download
4. ‚úÖ Train users on document upload process
5. ‚úÖ Set up storage monitoring
6. ‚úÖ Plan for storage limits and upgrades
