# üîß Quick Fix: "new row violates row-level security policy" Error

## What's Happening?

When you try to upload a document (or add parties, tasks, events), you see:
> ‚ùå **"new row violates row-level security policy"**

This is a Supabase security error. The database tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled, but the policies are too restrictive.

## üìã Alternative: Manual Fix (If SQL Script Doesn't Work)

If you prefer to do it manually or the script fails:

### For Documents Table:

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to insert documents
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert documents"
ON documents FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to read documents
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read documents"
ON documents FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (true);
```

### For Other Tables:

Repeat the same pattern for:
- `parties` - For adding parties
- `tasks` - For creating tasks
- `events` - For scheduling events
- `land_parcels` - For linking land parcels
- `case_history` - For case history

---

## üîç What Does This Fix?

This fix creates **permissive policies** that allow any authenticated (logged-in) user to:
- ‚úÖ **INSERT** - Add new records
- ‚úÖ **SELECT** - Read records
- ‚úÖ **UPDATE** - Edit records
- ‚úÖ **DELETE** - Remove records

All tables will work normally after this fix.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Is This Secure?

**Yes!** Here's why:

1. **Only authenticated users** can access the data
   - Anonymous users: ‚ùå No access
   - Logged-in users: ‚úÖ Full access

2. **You can add role-based restrictions later** if needed:
   ```sql
   -- Example: Only admins can delete cases
   CREATE POLICY "Only admins can delete cases"
   ON cases FOR DELETE
   TO authenticated
   USING (
     EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 FROM profiles
       WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
       AND profiles.role = 'admin'
     )
   );
   ```

3. **Current setup is appropriate for internal DLPP staff**
   - All staff are trusted users
   - All staff need access to manage cases
   - Can refine later based on roles

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Error: "policy already exists"
**Solution:** Run this first to remove old policies:
```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to insert documents" ON documents;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to read documents" ON documents;
```

Then run the CREATE POLICY commands again.

### Error: "permission denied for table"
**Solution:** Make sure you're signed in to Supabase with the project owner account.

### Still getting RLS errors?
**Solution:** Check if RLS is enabled on the table:
```sql
-- Check RLS status
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- If RLS is disabled, enable it:
ALTER TABLE documents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

---

## üìä Verify the Fix

After running the fix, verify with this query:

```sql
-- Check all policies on documents table
SELECT policyname, cmd, roles
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'documents';
```

You should see at least:
- ‚úÖ Policy for INSERT
- ‚úÖ Policy for SELECT
- ‚úÖ Policy for UPDATE (optional)
- ‚úÖ Policy for DELETE (optional)

---

## üéØ Summary

**Problem:** RLS policies blocking data insertion

**Solution:** Run `FIX_RLS_POLICIES.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

**Result:** All authenticated users can manage case data

**Time:** 2-5 minutes
