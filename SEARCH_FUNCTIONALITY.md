## üéØ Search Tips & Best Practices

### **For Best Results:**

1. **Be Specific**
   - Instead of: "land"
   - Try: "SEC 123 ALL 45"

2. **Use Case Numbers**
   - Quickest way to find case-related items
   - Example: "DLPP-2025-001"

3. **Partial Matches Work**
   - You don't need to type the full text
   - "affid" will find "affidavit"

4. **Search is Case-Insensitive**
   - "hohola" = "Hohola" = "HOHOLA"

5. **Use the Global Search for Unknown Location**
   - If you don't know which module an item is in
   - Global search finds it across everything

6. **Use Module Search for Focused Results**
   - If you know you're looking for a task
   - Use the Tasks page search for faster results
